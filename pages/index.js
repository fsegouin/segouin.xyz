      Ever thought our lives could be a lot easier? I do. I break stuff all the
      time to know how they're made in order to improve them. Yes I did break a
      lot of things but <b>I</b> also learned a lot along the way. I think many
      things we take for granted can be improved. Remember how long it used to
      take to get a website on the internet? We can now <b>do</b> this under 10
      seconds. Why couldn't we do this for everything else?

      Sometimes it's as easy as thinking outside of the box, and redefining how
      we use something. Centuries of habits and legacy prevent us from going
      forward. The good news is, we have the tools to change that. We can use
      today's technology to make everything we're used to see faster, easier,
      and cheaper. These principles are behind every single project I've worked
      on, and I know I achieved my goal the second I can see <b>magic</b> in
      people's eyes when I show them my work.
